# jQuery library for Composer

This is a just clone of the latest stable [official jQuery releases](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/releases), with no frills.

The module versions match the jQuery versions 1:1.

Backstory: I was relying heavily on [this package](https://github.com/components/jquery), however that project appears to be no longer maintained so I created this.


## Install
```
composer require axllent/jquery
```
